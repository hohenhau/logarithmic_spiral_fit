# Logarithmic Spiral Fit

A Script to fit logarithmic spirals to a pair of points (A and B) with specified coordinates and and angles. Instead of coordinates, the user can also define the length of vector AB (i.e. the chord length) and the curvature distribution (i.e. the stretch)

This script is intended for engineers who wish to construct curvature continuous curved diffusers with a constant rate of expansion. These diffusers can be adapted to the design of expansion turning vanes. More details on this process can be found in a publication titled "Parameterising the Geometry of Curved Diffusers and Expansion Vanes Using Logarithmic Spirals"
